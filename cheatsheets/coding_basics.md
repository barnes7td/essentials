**Principle 3:** Question all assumptions!
  * Use output to console
  * Learn debug steps (resource)
  * Be suspicious

**Principle 4:** Small Steps, Narrow Focus
  * Code to a User Story
  * Don't get distracted by other coding ideas
  * Write down bugs you find or ideas you have and do them later.
5. Create Feature, Fix Bug, or Refactor Code, but only 1 at a time.
6. Methods get input and return output. Always know what you are getting and what you're returning.
7. Think like a User. Empathize with the User.
8. Solve ugly and verbose first, then refactor
  * Find a solution first with trial and error.
  * Refactor till easily comprehensible.
9. Empathize with fellow coders.
10. Tell. Don't Ask.
