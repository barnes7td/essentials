# Coding Basics

## Principles

**Principle 1:** Code formatting matters!
  * Find a style guide and stick to it.
  * Learn Indentation (Indentation Resource)
  * Use parenthesis even if language doesn't require it.

**Principle 2:** Know your type! Know what they do.
  * Arrays
  * Numbers
  * Strings
  * Hashes
  * Booleans
  * Objects/Classes

**Principle 3:** Question all assumptions!
  * Use output to console
  * Learn debug steps (resource)
  * Be suspicious

**Principle 4:** Small Steps, Narrow Focus
  * Code to a User Story
  * Don't get distracted by other coding ideas
  * Write down bugs you find or ideas you have and do them later.

**Principle 5:** Create Feature, Fix Bug, or Refactor Code, but only 1 at a time.

**Principle 6:** Methods get input and return output. Always know what you are getting and what you're returning.

**Principle 7:** Think like a User. Empathize with the User.

**Principle 8:** Solve ugly and verbose first, then refactor
  1. Find a solution, by any means necessary.
  2. Refactor, with the goal of being comprehensible.
  3. Review. If needed, refactor again.

**Principle 9:** Use a for loop if you know the number of loops, else use a while loop.

**Principle 10:** The end product is the User Experience. It is the priority.
